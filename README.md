In the folder "Ml And AL lab final" there are two parts: solution and video. In the solution folder there are the solution of the follwing problems and in video folder there are the explanation of the solutions. 

Problem 1:

As a data scientist working in the healthcare industry, your task is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify medical images into their respective categories. 
The model should be able to accurately identify the type of medical image shown in an image, based on the image itself.
To complete the task, you can use the following dataset containing 18000+ color images of medical conditions from 5 different categories:
Brain MRI,  Chest CT, Abdomen CT, Hand X-ray, and Chest X-ray. Each image is of varying size and has three color channels (RGB). You need to split the dataset for training, validation and testing purpose. 
Note that you may need to preprocess the dataset and balance the classes to avoid a biased model.

Problem 2:

A banking institution wants to develop a model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not based on their banking behavior. 
They have collected a dataset of past customers with information about their demographics, account details, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not.
The bank wants to build a model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a new customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not based on their banking behavior.

The dataset used for this problem statement is the "Bank Marketing Data Set" which contains information on customers of a bank. 
The dataset includes 17 attributes such as customer demographics, account details, and whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit or not.
Each customer is classified as either yes or no based on whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not.
